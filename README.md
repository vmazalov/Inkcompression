# Ink Compression

This repo contains some of the experimentation files from my PhD for

1. Funcation approximation methods for compression of digital ink.
1. Linear-based ink compression for certain digital ink applications.

I put it here primarily for archiving, and it lacks proper documentation. If you are intersted/have questions, just message me. I will add documentation for the parts that people find usefull.
